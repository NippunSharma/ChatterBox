0,What is your review of Faculty Of IIT Mandi? ,"It’s not good. Even some NITs are way better than this college.

One of the faculty here is an associate here just because he published a lot of papers just by doing the same. So, at last i would say. if you are planning for the higher studies(specially in mechanical field) here then please do not come. "
1,What is your review of Faculty Of IIT Mandi? ,"★★ A2A :)I am neither a full time student of IIT Mandi nor I have spent some time there as a visiting student. Though I have gone through their Faculty Profiles provided at official website, It looks same as other newly established IITs (excluding IITH & IITGn, they are way better than others). "

The point I wanna draw is, your college’s newness doesn’t matter. Opportunity knocks on all doors, be good enough to grab it. :) "
4,What is the current placement scenario at IIT Mandi? ,"It has been almost 8 months living in IIT Mandi. There are both good and bad points. Let us start with good : There is no pollution.(I come from Delhi so its a major plus for me)The hostel food is okay and there are a few canteens to keep things changing.I reside in south campus, which is almost compContinue ReadingIt has been almost 8 months living in IIT Mandi. There are both good and bad points. Let us start with good : There is no pollution.(I come from Delhi so its a major plus for me)The hostel food is okay and there are a few canteens to keep things changing.I reside in south campus, which is almost completely constructed. Hence you wont feel lack of facilities.Wifi speed is okay.It is fully surrounded by mountains so the view is awesome.There are two rivers beside campus (there are ways to them). Whenever you feel out you can go to them.I am not much of a city person so on holidays i mostly go to trek around with friends.Teachers are good. Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all. Look for CS they are just like any other college good. If you are good at coding and have nice outlook you can get a 20–25 easy. For mech guys (like me) have to work hard to get placement. The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you. For electrical I don’t have any reviews but they are more or less like mech guys besides the fact that they are sometimes(mostly) hired by IT giants. Again for internships you need to work hard, they are the same as placement. The only plus point is that we have a semester exchange program where you can to Germany and study a sem there. It is beneficial. EDIT1 : IIT Mandi has been literally very good in tech fests. It has been the number one new IIT in inter IIT tech meets. "

You can also get games like carrom board, etc. from the funds.All in all, the hostels are pretty cool. Life at the hostels is, again, awesome. Saif’s answer on the question nearly sums up many aspects of the hostel life. As far as campus life is concerned, different people may have different views on it. I personally like my campus and hostel life at IIT Mandi a lot. Coming to ragging, you may face light ragging here, but nothing at all like the 3 Idiots one, “Jahaanpana, tussi great ho, tohfaa kubool karo”  The environment at IIT Mandi is amazingly peaceful. I remember a fourth year senior telling me just some weeks back before leaving the college: “Yaar baaki saare city wale colleges to aise hi hote hain, kya padhe kya nahi padhe sab bhool jaenge. Lekin iss jagah ko nhi bhool paenge, ye jagah bahut hi faad hain, aur sabse alag hain!” "
6,How is the hostel life and campus life at IIT Mandi? At what level is ragging at IIT Mandi? ,"Okay Anon thanks for A2A and sorry I might not be the right person to give you a satisfactory answer to this question. I'll try my best though. Well now that I am thinking what should I write here, I realized that I never had the time to think how my life is going there. I think I can put the blame on quite compact semester schedule. Due to a short 4 month semester and numerous small but fun inter/intra sports/tech-cult fest you will be extremely busy throughout the semester if you're socially active.

I'll try my best though. Well now that I am thinking what should I write here, I realized that I never had the time to think how my life is going there. I think I can put the blame on quite compact semester schedule. Due to a short 4 month semester and numerous small but fun inter/intra sports/tech-cult fest you will be extremely busy throughout the semester if you're socially active. Although life here is almost similar to any other good fully residential engineering college is India.  Let me put it down to as a short checklist. #1. Early morning classes.   				 [√]        Classes start as early as 8 am even during November.#2. Strict attendance requirements.    [√] 	 S-E-V-E-N-T-Y percent. And to top it all some teachers give marks for attendance. :'( #3. Mess food that will make you homesick. [√] You will miss your mother with almost every bite you take.#4. Canteens and Late night canteens.		 		 [√] Canteens. The best place to hangout at the start of the month. #5. Unfriendly Hitler type professors. 			 [x] * Most of them are friendly and experts in their fields. #6. Ragging.					 [x] Zero percent ragging. I and my CS team used to go in the fourth year hostel and play CS with them till 6 am. They were not only friendly but were equally cool. :) #7. Clubs that help you discover new passion and stick to the existing ones. [√] A lot of clubs and a lot to do.          More details here >> Indian Institute Of Technology Mandi#8. Nearby Malls, Cinema Theaters. 			[x] Well everything comes with a price. You'll have to sacrifice the city life, (un)fortunately. However there is one cinema hall in Mandi but the condition is not so good. #9. Some fests to lighten the mood.			[√]        It would unfair to say that all the fests here are legendary. But Exodia and Rann-Neeti are quite awesome if you get involved. :) Even the intra-college fests are cool, small but enjoyable. :)#10. Cool sports culture.				[√] Sport culture here is just awesome. Not just in the campus but even in Mandi, the people are great sports enthusiasts. Even during the end sems you can spot some people playing their favorite game.#11. Events to showcase your techincal and non-technical talents. [√]#12. Unlimited high speed internet .			[√]          Although it's has a lot of restrictions, but then restrictions are not there to prevent but to make you think/explore for a solution. That's all I can think of now. Hope it clears all of your doubts. If you want any specific details, I'll be happy to help. "
7,Is IIT Mandi the most beautiful IIt campus? ,"(A2A)Not necessarily. Although IIT Guwahati looks really attractive, photos on internet are not enough to compare college campuses (hundreds of acres of land). Presently, many IITs are still under construction and for IIT Mandi, more than 60% of the campus is mountainous. But let me mention a few clear positives of being here: IIT Mandi’s location make it a great place to spend some time at. It is essentially a valley surrounded by mountains. The river (Uhl, which is a right bank tributary of the river Beas) flowing down through the campus is the most unique feature of it (It is not as dangerous Continue Reading(A2A)Not necessarily. Although IIT Guwahati looks really attractive, photos on internet are not enough to compare college campuses (hundreds of acres of land). Presently, many IITs are still under construction and for IIT Mandi, more than 60% of the campus is mountainous. But let me mention a few clear positives of being here: IIT Mandi’s location make it a great place to spend some time at. It is essentially a valley surrounded by mountains. The river (Uhl, which is a right bank tributary of the river Beas) flowing down through the campus is the most unique feature of it (It is not as dangerous as it sounds). It really adds much elegance to its beauty by its clean running waters. Needless to say, sereneness of Kamand village and simplicity of Himachali people are a big bonus. Regarding weather: It experiences temperature ranging between 25-30 degrees during summers and a min temp of 0 in winters (yet there would be no snowfall, the advantage of being in a valley). The duration between September to November is considered the most pleasant of all times. If you wanna step out of campus, famous Grand places like Kullu-Manali and two major awesome lakes: Prashar and Rewalsar are a few hours drive away. YOu must google them if you haven’t already. Unparalleled in beauty, heritage, spirituality and adventure, there can never be a reason to not visit Himachal Pradesh. Bottom-line: You are situated at a place where India spends its vacations. Its quite a good deal for students who like travel and adventure. I have missed a lot of details, hopefully other answers will cover it. :) "

11,What's it like to attend IIT Mandi? ,"Hmm, well, I suppose I can answer this question as my first year here is just ending. First impressions first.

H Continue ReadingHmm, well, I suppose I can answer this question as my first year here is just ending. First impressions first. My mind was absolutely blown by the insane beauty of the place. The campus seemed small but on seeing pictures of older times when there were just 4–5 buildings in campus I thanked my luck! Here is a picture of campus from the last sem:  It has already grown , completing most of the in-construction buildings that you can see. The speed of construction here is absolutely insane to a person from Bombay like me! It amazes me that things can work at this speed in a place so remote. All thanks to our amazing Director, I suppose! This is a picture of the upcoming North Campus that we will later shift to.  NOW, get this, The North Campus and South Campus (where we are now) are separated by a mountain! I mean, How cool is that?! Of course, they are planning to connect the two, not only by road (which itself is just 5–10 minutes by buses). And coming to remoteness, it sure as hell is remote. All you can see are mountains. The permanent campus is about an hour away from the main Mandi town where we have to go to get most of the things needed. There are 2 canteens within the campus and a stall of sorts and a restaurant/cafe sort of thing. Once bored of visiting the same few joints within campus, you can go to The Treat ,outside campus, a 5–10 min walk from campus’s gate. Nothing out of the extraordinary, but decent enough. The provision and stationery stores fortunately save us from having to travel an hour just for a pencil or pen. So the first week is known as an Orientation week, organised by the awesome GCS (Guidance and Counselling Service) volunteers. It’s a whole lot of fun and you get to know a lot of the campus and a lot of people within it. Also, you find out a lot about Mandi town as well. :) I won’t spill their secrets, so you have fun in it if you’re planning to come! The sports trials take place and you ( being a girl ) get selected in all possible. I picked badminton, and started playing in the first week itself. The sports facility is surprisingly, commendable. After that, classes starts. Classes, since I’m sure you’d want to know, are decent. Some professors and really , mindblowingly good, but some aren’t. Sometimes, although the teacher may be brilliant you are just not made for the subjec t- this happened with me and Electrical systems around us. The instructor, Ramesh Oruganti, was amazing but for some reason I still got a C! Ah, well. It gets a bit monotonous soon, but they don’t let it stay that way. Soon there is Aakarshan and intros of each club. After Aakarshan, the freshers’ introduction to all the cultural clubs, there are auditions for core members of each. Simultaneously, the technical clubs begin their open sessions for the first years and we get introduced to all of them. Quizzes come and go and the semester goes on. We start making friends, and you get used to the place and all the greenery! Being one of the few girls is a bit difficult in the beginning but the girls stick together at that time. Later the boys get used to us and it’s normal. The sem goes on, sports events come up, convocation comes up, cult events (not many in odd sem) come up and technical events go on. You re-realize how beautiful the place is. For me, one of the best times of the first sem was when the Dance club and the Lit society decided to participate in Antaragni, IIT Kanpur’s fest. This is one of the best parts of being in a college with a small population. If you’re decent at anything, they take you in the club and teach you and make you better. I have learnt so much in the past year about so so many things and discovered so much more about myself. I certainly wouldn’t have had this opportunity. Somewhere near November, final trials for Inter IIT take place and crazy preparation begins. End-sems take place in the last week of November and after that, Inter IIT camp starts again and then you leave. ( well, we didn’t, because of the Chennai floods but this is the general scenario.) During November , fest work begins and people are taken into different teams and work begins and continues during the vacation. The vacation is unending. It. Is. Eternity. You lose your mind wanting to have something to do because you are completely jobless. You realise you have lost about 10 kgs in a semester and hog on some good home food and go to all your usual places and meet everybody you knew. Still, that ends but the vacation doesn’t. No work. Nothing to do. No clothes to wash, no room to keep clean, no technical event to participate , no dance practice NOTHING. It is horrible for a while and then either you get used to it or start doing something at home. This year, we hosted the Inter IIT Tech-Meet, in January, but since that came during vacations, only a handful people witnessed it. The second semester, you are super happy to be back but also, obviously missing the beautiful home food. Its similar to the first except much much much much much (I could go on for eternity) more hectic. Many more events take place, this time alongside course projects. You realize how free you were in the previous semester. And Exodia happens. All the work, since November, culminates into one grand event filled with absolutely no sleep and too much work . Your respect increases for the certain few who you know carried out the whole fest on their shoulders. Those three days are the best days of the year. At the end of it, there is victory. Lot of work left but still , it’s over. We have done it. Well, they have done it! It’s a good feeling. The sem goes on. You re-realize how beautiful the place is. All the fourth years are now filled with nostalgia and are way too free since they have few credits left to complete. So they keep their club meetings much more often and you go for them because “Aww they’re leaving soon” :( For a person like me, who is practically in each club , there are too many farewells to handle. But it was worth it. It surprises me how many people leaving have made such a huge impression on me within one year. We organize the farewells gladly and basically, party hard. The courses are tougher, at least for me, so we also have to work hard . This sem, no one gets much sleep. I suppose it’s going to get even worse with each year. And now, endsems are here again and I am here on Quora instead of there , studying. So what’s it like? Its amazing, painful, annoying, lonely, scary, brilliant, beautiful and TIRING everything at once. The people you meet are people you will remember forever and the knowledge you learn (no, I am not talking about the classes) will stay with you. The friends you make,you hope to keep forever and the memories you will certainly cherish for life. Of course, this is all if you get off your butt and go participate in whatever is going on. I have made it a point to spend most days (and many nights) out of my room, meeting people, making things, working, sometimes even studying, talking, partying, practicing, or maybe just walking with a friend or two. If you decide to sit in your room and surf Quora all day, then its the same as home .(Actually, it’s worse because its without the good food!) So, participate and IIT Mandi will gladly be there to help you. :) "

The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you. For electrical I don’t have any reviews but they are more or less like mech guys besides the fact that they are sometimes(mostly) hired by IT giants. Again for internships you need to work hard, they are the same as placement. The only plus point is that we have a semester exchange program where you can to Germany and study a sem there. It is beneficial. EDIT1 : IIT Mandi has been literally very good in tech fests. It has been the number one new IIT in inter IIT tech meets. "

A medical unit has also been established in the campus for taking care of minor injuries and diseases. And there are also both private and government hospitals in Mandi town. As of now, there are four canteens in the South Campus and a semi-restaurant which goes by the name of Kamand-Treat in close proximity to the campus. Thanks. "

Whenever you feel out you can go to them.I am not much of a city person so on holidays i mostly go to trek around with friends.Teachers are good. Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all.

IIT Mandi’s vision is to be leader in science and technology education, knowledge creation and innovation, in an India marching towards a just, inclusive and sustainable society.  Campus Insights The Institute’s main campus, called Kamand Campus, is located in the picturesque Uhl river valley at Kamand, which is situated at about 15 kms from the historic town of Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. IIT Mandi is the first among new IITs to develop and use its main campus.  IIT Mandi permanent campus is located at Kamand and is divided into two parts: South and North Campus. All the 4 B.tech Batches along with some PG students stay at South Campus. Most of the PG students stay at North Campus. The residential campus in the serene landscape by the river Uhl offers a world-class academic environment with a high quality of life in a setting of natural splendor. The main campus of IIT Mandi at Kamand has well equipped class rooms and computing facilities. Good teaching laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Mechanical Engineering have been developed at Kamand campus.  Clubs The Tech-savvy students have formed various clubs related to Technology. Some of them are: Robotronics Club: A society which conducts regular workshops and combines the robotics with electronics along with the ""RoboWars"" for the ""Robo"" Freaks. Programming Club: A society ,especially for the coders, to explore new possibilities in programming and to put their skills to test at the same time. All technical clubs are active in organizing seminars and competitions. Many of the students have published research papers along with the faculty members with the assistance of the technical clubs. Societies and Events IIT Mandi witnesses a great participation in all the events conducted by the cultural and literary societies. These societies conduct events regularly for ensuring the development of the cultural and literary skills of the students.  The literary society of IIT Mandi EDLS (English Debating and Literary Society) makes sure that events like Group Discussions,Debates and Just a Minute are organised every two weeks to enhance the communication skills of the students. The Music society, Dramatics society and the Dance society are also very active in conducting competitions and group events with a view to ensure that the students learn the importance of a synchronized effort for victory. The dance, literary and music society participated in Antaragini at IIT Kanpur. Exodia is the annual Tech-Cult Fest of IIT Mandi. The events in Exodia brought together the creative skills and talents of the students and provided an enriching experience to one and all. Management of such a large scale fest is done entirely by students, from cold calling sponsors and inviting participating to real time management of the events. Hostel Facility  IIT Mandi has fully residential campus with the current strength of approximately 1300 students residing in 5 boys’ hostels and 2 girls’ hostels. At present these hostels are situated in the two campuses. The south campus consists four hostels; Prashar hostel, Suvalsar hostel, Nako hostel and Chandra Taal Hostel. The north campus has three hostels; Beas Kund Hostel, Dashir hostel and Gauri Kund hostel and one more is coming up.  Currently there are four messes in the campus, two each in both campuses, that serve food to all hostelers. The food quality and menu in these messes is regularly supervised and controlled by the team of mess secretaries elected by the students body. Besides, There are five to six canteens in campus that gives a variety of food options to students.  IIT Mandi can boast of world class hostel facilities inside the hostels, as all the hostels are equipped with WI-FI internet connection, LCD television, washing machine, cloth dryer, microwave oven, induction heater, refrigerator, electric iron and facilities for indoor games such table tennis, foosball, carom etc. Management of hostel is taken care by the warden and assistant warden with the help of a caretaker. Caretaker is available in the hostel round the clock. Each hostel has its own student general body of student representatives in the form of general secretary, cultural secretary, sports secretary and mess secretary. Sports  Sports occupy the pride of place in the hearts of the students of IIT Mandi.The college organises regular inter hostel and intra hostel sports events to promote the athletes and to encourage the students to improve their physical stamina.

If someone has problems, you are most welcome to skip reading the content below. Campus : On a serious note, I feel IIT Mandi doesn’t have a good infrastructure, when compared with all others, in the entire IIT family. One should clearly remember that beautiful hills, mountains, rivers, waterfalls and clouds are not a part of the IIT Mandi campus. They are simply outside the campus and certainly not constructed by the development authorities. Stop saying that IIT Mandi has a beautiful campus just because of the natural resources present outside the campus and the hilly view is mesmerizing and beautiful. IIT Mandi has simply failed to build a good permanent and a planned campus despite of the fact that ~12 years have passed since its establishment. There are 2 campuses in IIT Mandi - North campus and the South campus. IIT Mandi’s South campus : The South campus is completely temporary in design and construction.The authorities keep on digging up and constructing stuff, again demolishing the same structures and performing the same construction again and this has been repeating for years.Majority of the construction in the south campus is temporary which will be demolished once the new director joins this year.As soon as you enter the south campus, a lot of structures on your left, as you walk towards the ground, are extremely poorly built just like local huts in any remote area and they exist even after years of college establishment.As you enter the South campus and proceed towards the main play-ground, you will find nothing but majority of washrooms on your left and that too poorly maintained and built. Which IIT campus in India, you will find series of washrooms as you soon as you enter the campus.Just at the beginning of the south campus, there is a local canteen called CVR canteen that serves the most unhygienic food on the entire campus. It is more of a provision store and less of a canteen. The level of hygiene here is simply unbearable. The cooks prepare food, take bath and wash clothes in the same kitchen itself. The prepared snacks are kept inside the glass containers full of insects, rodents including cockroaches. There is no cleanliness in the sitting area. I don’t feel such type of canteen should exist in any Indian college or university. They include over 50 different food items but prepare not more than 5 or 6. Any genuine complain against unhygienic setting etc. is not addressed properly. I personally feel, that the canteen is heavily and too much backed up, by the college authorities.Now coming to the ground, which is another spot for never ending construction. The policy they follow is simply to build, demolish and repeat. The authorities construct and demolish the structures again and again. Some issue with the civil department too, I guess.The pathways and the roads inside the South campus are extremely poor in quality and keeps worsening especially during rains.The most irritating part is the construction debris due to the entire campus being dug up again and again. The connecting sanitation and drainage pipelines are just not properly planned and implemented due to which water keeps flowing everywhere and getting collected.There are no proper canteens in the entire South campus where you can have reasonable and quality food. Few of the existing so called canteens operating inside the campus pay hefty amount of revenue to the college authorities which allow them to operate. There is a small stall like canteen called as ‘BulBul’ canteen that will prepare veg maggie and chicken in the same pan messing everything. Recently its owner was fined Rs. 5000 for utter unhygienic environment he has inside. No new vendors are allowed or given permit unless they agree to pay a heavy part of their money to college authorities. You cannot have simple south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, vada or good quality bakery items like burger, hotdog, puffs, pastry & cakes, sandwiches, pizzas etc. There is just one very simple canteen that serves extremely overpriced and very limited food items like desserts and shakes with no food variety at all. There are simply no provisions at all. There are no arrangements for any sort of fast food chains to operate inside the campus unlike all other IITs. Also since the area is remote, there are no hopes from outside the campus as well. You are suppose to travel to Mandi town to enjoy some of the delicacies or survive on maggie and parathas. Personally, I have stopped eating from any the canteens especially CVR and the BulBul.IIT Mandi’s North campus : IIT Mandi’s north campus is the most unplanned and illogical campus that any IIT may possibly have. The entire construction takes place at random and as I previously mentioned that they are still constructing the main sections of the campus even till today.The amount of planning that should have been involved while constructing the main North campus is zero. They constructed hostels right in front of the faculty and staff quarters. Also the architecture and design of the construction looks quite uglier. The buildings have just been whitewashed and the construction authorities still haven’t progressed to painting. There are broken pieces of big rocks and construction debris all over. The drainage pipes run from anywhere to everywhere spilling out water on the pathways and making it a complete mess during rains.Majority of the labs and hostels are still in construction. The existing labs are extremely poor on resources and basic lab facilities. The new lab in which I work is extremely low on seating capacity and system resources. Previously labs operated from the South campus and the situations were the same. The same is the situation for the students of the other departments as well. The college has simply failed to build decent lab and computing facilities even after so many years. Since the construction was poor in logic and design, so is the lab facility in most of the streams. Just placing some old systems & material in a small area does not constitute a premier and state of the art computing lab.There are almost no canteens available on the campus. They have recently opened a fast food outlet called ‘OneBite’ but again the quality and variety is very limited and promising. The college authorities still don’t actively supports the outlet yet. It is extremely surprising to see hygienic and quality checks happening in ‘OneBite’ but not at all in the unhygienic CVR or BulBul Canteen in the South campus just because they may be backed up by certain college authorities.Even it is the main campus of IIT Mandi, still they don’t have any fast-food or traditional Indian style restaurants operating on campus. IIT Roorkee has Subway, PizzaHut, IIT Kanpur has CCD, Dominoes, IIT Bombay has Nescafe and so on. I don’t remember the exact list of the food outlets and restaurants in other IITs as well but IIT Mandi practically has none. Both the campuses of IIT Mandi have no hostel canteens or late night canteens. However I found mess food to be very good in both the IIT campuses. D1 mess in South campus is simply great.There is no quality furniture in the labs, hostels and inside libraries. Also the amount of academic material that should be present inside an IIT library is way less. Since I work in the CSE department, to my utter surprise, the main CSE (MANAS) lab is extremely weak on seating capacities, quality furniture, lab equipments. Most of the system comprises of old material and components and haven’t been upgraded since years. I personally felt that most of the elite and premier schools in Delhi have a much better built computer labs than this, apart from few of the advanced computing facilities currently being integrated or already integrated into. It is surprising to witness a new generation IIT demonstrating so low standards of core computer science lab, despite of completing 10 years of its establishment.Outside the campus : Again, this parameter is disappointing as it is majority of the local people who aim for employment and business due to existing IIT. The restaurants are very local in nature and don’t offer quality and variety in food items. Again the same hygiene issue persists.There are a lot number of provision stores outside. If you visit nearby areas such as Salgi, Katindi or Kamand, you will find 99% of the shops are nothing but provision stores. I expected variety such as garments shop, cafeterias, footwear shops, stationary shops, medical stores etc. But to the utter disappointment, all the locals are operating provision stores.There is not even a single medical store outside the campus. The local food outlets also serve the same thing: tea, coffee, parathas and maggie.The CSE labs and infrastructure is still not sufficient and strong to provide best of the opportunities. The faculty is extremely good and competitive however and one should remember that they are ultimately practising traditional & conventional teaching methodology as well as just doing their job mostly as an another govt. service or duty. Extremely and extremely few of them are really helpful and motivating but others are not and the same story goes for most of the elite Indian engineering campuses. Placements : Placements are extremely good especially for the much coveted CSE stream. Top product based firms hire in good numbers from the campus. Overall extremely competitive placements are offered to its graduates. However core engineering departments still don’t have that great placements and those students opt for software or non-tech profile roles mostly in general. College Life : Personally college life, is not that great due to the lack of hangout zones both inside and outside the campus. Since the area is remote, there are no chill out zones outside too. The sports facilities are below average owning to the limited space of the college campus in the remote area but things are building up gradually. One may join college clubs and societies to participate in more of varied events and activities but the bitter truth is that the excitement and curiosity due to the scenic and appealing natural beauty will fade away in a few months and one may feel sort of trapped inside. The place is ideal for researchers who want a peaceful environment conducive to their work area. Hope that helps and excuse me for typos or grammatical errors, if any.

There are both good and bad points. Let us start with good : There is no pollution.(I come from Delhi so its a major plus for me)The hostel food is okay and there are a few canteens to keep things changing.I reside in south campus, which is almost completely constructed. Hence you wont feel lack of facilities.Wifi speed is okay.It is fully surrounded by mountains so the view is awesome.There are two rivers beside campus (there are ways to them). Whenever you feel out you can go to them.I am not much of a city person so on holidays i mostly go to trek around with friends.Teachers are good. Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all. Look for CS they are just like any other college good. If you are good at coding and have nice outlook you can get a 20–25 easy. For mech guys (like me) have to work hard to get placement. The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you. For electrical I don’t have any reviews but they are more or less like mech guys besides the fact that they are sometimes(mostly) hired by IT giants. Again for internships you need to work hard, they are the same as placement. The only plus point is that we have a semester exchange program where you can to Germany and study a sem there. It is beneficial. EDIT1 : IIT Mandi has been literally very good in tech fests. It has been the number one new IIT in inter IIT tech meets. "

Hefty salary packages, research environment, passionate classmates and young faculty, all place IIT mandi CS at among top program in country. While Mechanical department is still lagging with faculty numbers, infrastructure and quality course framework. But many PSU’s like BPCL,ISRO, Coal India are offering good opportunities to Bachelors students, which suggest that IIT mandi offers a good learning environment to its students. "
