You can find the Branch Change rules on the JOSAA Website or the IIT Mandi Website. The difficulty depends on you. How well you can manage the courses. They are easy. You just need to be attentive in class and do the assignments yourself.,What are branch changing rules at IIT Mandi? How difficult is it?
"Yes, they do. Here at IIT Mandi, we have interdisciplinary learning and we have schools instead of Departments. There are no Dept. Of CS Engg. and Dept. Of Electrical Engg.! Instead, we have SCEE (School of Computing and Electrical Engineering). One advantage is that If you come with EE and realise that you want to go to IT sector, you can easily take up courses of CSE, sometimes more than CSE guys do.",Does electrical and cse department in Mandi coincide?

"Data Science at IIT Mandi to a great extent will be comparable to CSE only. Many of the courses will be similar or even same! (Some dedicated core Data Science courses are introduced in the curriculum though and those are the only ones which differentiate the branches.) I don't believe you're completely aware about either of the branches currently. I'd definitely suggest to join the Data Science course, irrespective of it starting this year only. And hence, advise you to come here, explore the courses related to both the branches (while being in DSE) and then decide about changing your branch from DSE (you may just want to stay in DSE as it won't make much difference IMO) At last, the 'risk' you're thinking you may have to take will be very little compared to other branches. Because even if you stay in DSE, I'd say, it'll be as good as CSE at IIT Mandi. Hope this helps!","What do seniors think about the Data Science course at IIT Mandi ?

"There are institute buses which you can take free of cost, or you can take a cab from mandi bus stand.",How to reach IIT mandi from mandi bus stand ?
"Yes, IIT Mandi is safe from avalanche, flood, landslides and other natural calamities. I agree that mountains roads are not safe for journey in rainy season and Snow fall duration. But if you are coming to mandi from chandigarh then you can easily come to campus. But if you are coming to mandi from manali side then in rainy season you may face land slides and other things but himachal government is very active regarding to help people in the case of land slides and heavy snow fall. So if you are thinking about be a part of IIT Mandi then feel free to try to be a part of IIT Mandi. ",Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities? Are the mountain roads easy to travel or is there any danger? 
Avalanches occur at places where it snow heavily and a wide layer of snow is present on the mountains. Here there is no such snow so no chances of avalanche. In rainy season sometimes landslides occur on the road joining South and North campus as well as Road towards Mandi. But IIT MANDI has installed landslide sensors which alert the nearby people. So there is no such risk. The only problem in mountain roads is it takes much more time to travel as compared to plains. For eg: Distance b/w IIT KAMAND campus and MANDI town is 15 kms and it takes around 45 minutes for us to travel. ,Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities? Are the mountain roads easy to travel or is there any danger? 
"IIT Mandi is safe and peaceful place. No avalanches and well connected with roads. No issues. But, in rainy season there can be landslides anywhere in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh. So, uncertainty of landslide is still everywhere in every mountain of Himachal. Though there is extensive research going on for forecasting landslides points at mountains. Overall there is no such regular natural disaster kind of things. Safe and peacefulness of IIT Mandi can make us in love with nature. ",Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities?

Okay, so when I had heard about the fact that my campus (then going to be) has a river flowing through it, I was so damn excited that I literally started to have dreams about it. I'm an amid nature lover, can wander for days, travelling is my wife and photography is my girlfriend. Sorry to have an extramarital affair! I was so mesmerised when I first saw it, viewing those clouds floating above like a carefree traveller and in those misty and fluffy clouds I could see my days ahead very clearly, ironically! Within a weak, I went on its shore, touched it's crystal clear blue water and even wrote a poem sitting on a rock there for a couple of hours. As they say, once you've taken a step it's hard to reconcile. That first visit instilled in me the desire to embrace those moments again…and again…and again. Me and my friends once even bunked the classes to go and take a bath in it some 7–8 kms from our campus. That was an amazing day, we returned with wet clothes, loadful of laughter, a couple of nicknames and lots of memories to go down the pages of my “campus diary”. The river became a part of my life, just like the mountains had…just like the campus had… …until my birthday this year, the year 2017. When my friends were planning a surprise party for my birthday and I with my other batchmate was looking for my friend. “Looking” is not the word that screams the aura of that moment…”searching” might do the job. It was just a packet of few students who got serious about him missing, but it didn't take much ticks of the clock that entire campus got involved. It was a tensed moment. I am not going to narrate the incident, I'm not the right person for that. But it was around 1:30 am, 17th Feb 2017…i was getting wishing calls from my relatives and there I heard the gravest new. The river dried that night, the river dried for me. Since that day, I've not stepped on the shore of that river. Truth this, I couldn't dare to. It's been a couple of months since that night, and now when I've been knocked into my senses again I want to say this. The river is not dangerous. Look, it was an accident. No good will come out finding the flaws in it. But a couple of lessons would surely enlighten us. NEVER underestimate the power of nature. It's the most beautiful and the most dangerous creation. I'm not saying stop enjoying it, but enjoy within your sphere. Don't get carried away with your adrenaline rush, keep a check on it. Break the rules, not laws. Go visit the river, but never go when it's dark. And never go alone. You don't know what magic a hand on your shoulder can do when you need it. Don't experiment, like climbing on things which are not approachable. Of course, it could be new experience but ask yourself at what cost? The Uhl is one of the many blessings that IIT Mandi is blessed with. It sings you a soft lullaby every night. It adds the mesmerising hue of sunset to your tea every evening. It listens to you when no one else does. You can sit for hours looking at it from the campus and it won't stop surprising you. And not to forget those countless selfies! The river is beautiful, it's amazing and it's not dangerous. And even now if I'm unable to express that the river is not dangerous, then probably everything is dangerous. The bike you drive. The room you stay in. The food you eat. The friends you meet. You just have to keep everything withing limits, don't break the limits. The only limits to be broken are your own, not others'. ",Is the Uhl river near IIT Mandi dangerous? 
"“One can remain safe as long as one heeds to the advice of elders and take actions consciously”. Talking about Uhl river, the water level of the river is quite unpredictable. In mountains, rains can happen anytime and the water level rises. That’s why time and again, Institute keeps on informing students about the risks involved in going to the river side. Multiple warning signs have been installed and security guards have been appointed at every possible location of going near the river.

"NH 1 connects Delhi to Chandigarh so you’ll hardly find any trouble till Chandigarh. If you are travelling by bus, you can find a direct bus( Volvo/ Ordinary) from Delhi till Mandi.

During my time at IIT Mandi, I used to travel to and from Chandigarh every semester. I personally have never encountered such a happening on Chandigarh - Manali highway. The Volvo drivers are extremely skilled & agile and road conditions are much better than in the inner reaches of HP. But the ride is not that comfortable considering the number of bends on the highway. Then again, who said reaching heaven was easy? :) Safe journey! ",How do I reach IIT Mandi from Chandigarh in the safest way possible? 
You can only take a bus/ cab from Mandi. The most comfortable are the Volvo buses that you can book from hrtc ticketing website. It's perfectly safe and very common. The drivers are experienced and well trained for these routes. Even the route is fairly straight and wide. ,How do I reach IIT Mandi from Chandigarh in the safest way possible?

Bus service is widely distributed to Shimla so you don’t need to wry about time, just go to stand and you can get your bus. Volvo bus is also available for Shimla. Another way is that you can get a taxi or you can take zoomcar. Zoomcar is rental car service that charges according to the usage of car and petrol. You can book a car online and take that one but one thing I forget to mention that you have to drive the car on your own in zoomcar service. ",What are the bus timings from Chandigarh to Mandi?

Whereas iitkgp being one of the most reputed institutes of india it will be a nice choice if you opt chemical engineering here as this industry is in dire demands nowadays and will be in future ,and it's course structure is relatively easy as compared to other departments like mech or electrical.You will have sufficient time to hone your other skills and enjoy your college life.In this way you can prepare yourself fir non core jobs as most of the companies allow chemical students to appear in placement interviews and internships.If you want to pursue MBA outside India being a kgpian will give you an edge over other as it's ranking is much better than iit mandi.Moreover you have an option of branch change here at the end of 1 year ,you just need to get a good cgpa and you can choose department of your choice but that solely should not be the criteria to choose college or branch.So the argument here is between a branch and a college and I have presented my views and would suggest you if you want to stay safe then going for mandi cs would be better option and if you don't feel comfortable with coding stuff then kgp chemical will be better.

Pros: First of all, the scenic beauty of the Himalayas. Given the knowledge that it is also close to your home, you would love to be at Mandi. Though eventually you might end up disliking the mountains because of your 4 years stay there. This happened to a lot of my friends but the same was not the case with me.

Pros: First of all, the scenic beauty of the Himalayas. Given the knowledge that it is also close to your home, you would love to be at Mandi. Though eventually you might end up disliking the mountains because of your 4 years stay there. This happened to a lot of my friends but the same was not the case with me. I still love them as much I loved them when I first went to IIT Mandi.The opportunities are numerous. Since, the amount of students is less in IIT Mandi, you will get a lot of opportunities in every field. In my first year, I was not a very good TT player but still I made it to Inter IIT sports tournament. Well this is a really great thing because I have seen my friends in other IITs who have much more talent than me and still struggle to get into the Inter IIT team and eventually are not able to make it because there are students who are more talented than them.The opportunities don't limit to the Inter IIT sports fest. You get to participate in each and every student club activity. Given that we had less number of students, the cultural and technical clubs were open to all the students without any sort of recruitment. But this does not mean that you won't have to work anywhere. The students who did not work eventually separated out from the people who did.Easy approach to faculty and staff. Where it takes a lot of days to get your request processed in a big college, you will find it extremely easy to approach any teacher or staff for any problem. Even the Director is easily accessible.Cons: The Campus. I think I don't need to explain this drawback. But for details, permanent campus which is being built in Kamand, 15 kms ahead of Mandi is going to be really good when it completes.The lack of faculty. You will face a serious problem in this area because this is a new IIT and most of the teachers you see will be inexperienced.No recreational facilities. You must know beforehand that people of Mandi are very conservative and there is no source of entertainment on weekends like malls or shopping complexes. There is only one theater and believe me you will not want to go and see a movie there unless you see the price which is 30-40 Rs. per ticket. So, in all you will be spending the weekend either in the room sleeping, or talking with friends or visiting the campus just because you have to download some movies or TV serials. It will be really good if you make trekking as one of your habits.College Culture. There is no defined culture or college life as you consider it. You will not be able to get the real feel of a college life.The Placements. There comes the issue which you will probably be most worried about. I must say that there were very less number of companies which came for internships and jobs, in contrast to BITS Pilani where the number is much larger. The reasons being that it is a new IIT and that the place is very inaccessible. Most of the companies just deny coming to the college because it is 7 hours journey by bus from Chandigarh. Though there is a airport at Bhuntar (2 hours away) but you can say that it is almost non functional.Well, given all the points in favor and against, I would suggest you one thing. Don't rely on opinion of other people because everyone has his/her own perspective. When I entered into IIT Mandi, my friends mocked me for having made such a bad choice but I ended up getting placed at Amazon Development Center, India. So, set your preferences and then make a decision because at the end whichever college you go to, what will matter is not the contribution of college but the hard work you did. Best of luck for your coming years :D ",Is IIT Mandi or Bits Pilani better for studying Computer Science?

As placements at the new IITs are not yet at par with their older counterparts, IIT Mandi will take some time to reach there.

Also there is a huge difference between the number of companies that visit at BITS Pilani (Pilani) and the new IITs given the reputation and alumni presence of BITS Pilani. Apart from tech. companies a lot consultancy firms and banks come to Pilani for recruitment which broadens your future prospects. (2) Research: The research opportunities that you get at BITS are phenomenal with their system of SOP/COP/LOP (Study/Computer/Lab Oriented Project) which you can take up from your 2nd year itself. Also the opportunities that you get through PS-I( compulsory summer Intern after your 2nd year) and PS-II( compulsory 6 months long internship or 6 months long thesis opportunity after your 3rd year) are invaluable as an undergrad.  (3) Campus culture/ Peer group: BITS Pilani will give you an awesome peer group (with the No Reservation Policy) which I think is very important. Also the campus culture is well developed which I think you will miss at IIT Mandi as someone has already pointed out ""you won't get the feel of a good college life"". The campus culture at BITS  is great, with a large number of clubs and departments it gives you ample opportunities to develop yourself over your college years. Fests like Oasis ( the best after IIT Bombay's Mood Indigo) and Apogee are an awesome experience.  (4) Alumni: BITS has got a very strong alumni network. I think the alumni network of BITS is one of it's kind, with groups like BITS2MSPHD, BITS2BSCHOOL and BITStoIAS the alumni are constantly connected to the current students and are really helpful. Now the only issue i guess is the fees at BITS. Yeah It is costly, but with the hike in the fees there has been a rise in the number of scholarships they offer too. btw many congratulations to you on getting a great JEE rank and an awesome BITSAT score. Good Luck :) ",Is IIT Mandi or Bits Pilani better for studying Computer Science?

If someone has problems, you are most welcome to skip reading the content below. Campus : On a serious note, I feel IIT Mandi doesn’t have a good infrastructure, when compared with all others, in the entire IIT family. One should clearly remember that beautiful hills, mountains, rivers, waterfalls and clouds are not a part of the IIT Mandi campus. They are simply outside the campus and certainly not constructed by the development authorities. Stop saying that IIT Mandi has a beautiful campus just because of the natural resources present outside the campus and the hilly view is mesmerizing and beautiful. IIT Mandi has simply failed to build a good permanent and a planned campus despite of the fact that ~12 years have passed since its establishment. There are 2 campuses in IIT Mandi - North campus and the South campus. IIT Mandi’s South campus : The South campus is completely temporary in design and construction.The authorities keep on digging up and constructing stuff, again demolishing the same structures and performing the same construction again and this has been repeating for years.Majority of the construction in the south campus is temporary which will be demolished once the new director joins this year.As soon as you enter the south campus, a lot of structures on your left, as you walk towards the ground, are extremely poorly built just like local huts in any remote area and they exist even after years of college establishment.As you enter the South campus and proceed towards the main play-ground, you will find nothing but majority of washrooms on your left and that too poorly maintained and built. Which IIT campus in India, you will find series of washrooms as you soon as you enter the campus.Just at the beginning of the south campus, there is a local canteen called CVR canteen that serves the most unhygienic food on the entire campus. It is more of a provision store and less of a canteen. The level of hygiene here is simply unbearable. The cooks prepare food, take bath and wash clothes in the same kitchen itself. The prepared snacks are kept inside the glass containers full of insects, rodents including cockroaches. There is no cleanliness in the sitting area. I don’t feel such type of canteen should exist in any Indian college or university. They include over 50 different food items but prepare not more than 5 or 6. Any genuine complain against unhygienic setting etc. is not addressed properly. I personally feel, that the canteen is heavily and too much backed up, by the college authorities.Now coming to the ground, which is another spot for never ending construction. The policy they follow is simply to build, demolish and repeat. The authorities construct and demolish the structures again and again. Some issue with the civil department too, I guess.The pathways and the roads inside the South campus are extremely poor in quality and keeps worsening especially during rains.The most irritating part is the construction debris due to the entire campus being dug up again and again. The connecting sanitation and drainage pipelines are just not properly planned and implemented due to which water keeps flowing everywhere and getting collected.There are no proper canteens in the entire South campus where you can have reasonable and quality food. Few of the existing so called canteens operating inside the campus pay hefty amount of revenue to the college authorities which allow them to operate. There is a small stall like canteen called as ‘BulBul’ canteen that will prepare veg maggie and chicken in the same pan messing everything. Recently its owner was fined Rs. 5000 for utter unhygienic environment he has inside. No new vendors are allowed or given permit unless they agree to pay a heavy part of their money to college authorities. You cannot have simple south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, vada or good quality bakery items like burger, hotdog, puffs, pastry & cakes, sandwiches, pizzas etc. There is just one very simple canteen that serves extremely overpriced and very limited food items like desserts and shakes with no food variety at all. There are simply no provisions at all. There are no arrangements for any sort of fast food chains to operate inside the campus unlike all other IITs. Also since the area is remote, there are no hopes from outside the campus as well. You are suppose to travel to Mandi town to enjoy some of the delicacies or survive on maggie and parathas. Personally, I have stopped eating from any the canteens especially CVR and the BulBul.IIT Mandi’s North campus : IIT Mandi’s north campus is the most unplanned and illogical campus that any IIT may possibly have. The entire construction takes place at random and as I previously mentioned that they are still constructing the main sections of the campus even till today.The amount of planning that should have been involved while constructing the main North campus is zero. They constructed hostels right in front of the faculty and staff quarters. Also the architecture and design of the construction looks quite uglier. The buildings have just been whitewashed and the construction authorities still haven’t progressed to painting. There are broken pieces of big rocks and construction debris all over. The drainage pipes run from anywhere to everywhere spilling out water on the pathways and making it a complete mess during rains.Majority of the labs and hostels are still in construction. The existing labs are extremely poor on resources and basic lab facilities. The new lab in which I work is extremely low on seating capacity and system resources. Previously labs operated from the South campus and the situations were the same. The same is the situation for the students of the other departments as well. The college has simply failed to build decent lab and computing facilities even after so many years. Since the construction was poor in logic and design, so is the lab facility in most of the streams. Just placing some old systems & material in a small area does not constitute a premier and state of the art computing lab.There are almost no canteens available on the campus. They have recently opened a fast food outlet called ‘OneBite’ but again the quality and variety is very limited and promising. The college authorities still don’t actively supports the outlet yet. It is extremely surprising to see hygienic and quality checks happening in ‘OneBite’ but not at all in the unhygienic CVR or BulBul Canteen in the South campus just because they may be backed up by certain college authorities.Even it is the main campus of IIT Mandi, still they don’t have any fast-food or traditional Indian style restaurants operating on campus. IIT Roorkee has Subway, PizzaHut, IIT Kanpur has CCD, Dominoes, IIT Bombay has Nescafe and so on. I don’t remember the exact list of the food outlets and restaurants in other IITs as well but IIT Mandi practically has none. Both the campuses of IIT Mandi have no hostel canteens or late night canteens. However I found mess food to be very good in both the IIT campuses. D1 mess in South campus is simply great.There is no quality furniture in the labs, hostels and inside libraries. Also the amount of academic material that should be present inside an IIT library is way less. Since I work in the CSE department, to my utter surprise, the main CSE (MANAS) lab is extremely weak on seating capacities, quality furniture, lab equipments. Most of the system comprises of old material and components and haven’t been upgraded since years. I personally felt that most of the elite and premier schools in Delhi have a much better built computer labs than this, apart from few of the advanced computing facilities currently being integrated or already integrated into. It is surprising to witness a new generation IIT demonstrating so low standards of core computer science lab, despite of completing 10 years of its establishment.Outside the campus : Again, this parameter is disappointing as it is majority of the local people who aim for employment and business due to existing IIT. The restaurants are very local in nature and don’t offer quality and variety in food items. Again the same hygiene issue persists.There are a lot number of provision stores outside. If you visit nearby areas such as Salgi, Katindi or Kamand, you will find 99% of the shops are nothing but provision stores. I expected variety such as garments shop, cafeterias, footwear shops, stationary shops, medical stores etc. But to the utter disappointment, all the locals are operating provision stores.There is not even a single medical store outside the campus. The local food outlets also serve the same thing: tea, coffee, parathas and maggie.The CSE labs and infrastructure is still not sufficient and strong to provide best of the opportunities. The faculty is extremely good and competitive however and one should remember that they are ultimately practising traditional & conventional teaching methodology as well as just doing their job mostly as an another govt. service or duty. Extremely and extremely few of them are really helpful and motivating but others are not and the same story goes for most of the elite Indian engineering campuses. Placements : Placements are extremely good especially for the much coveted CSE stream. Top product based firms hire in good numbers from the campus. Overall extremely competitive placements are offered to its graduates. However core engineering departments still don’t have that great placements and those students opt for software or non-tech profile roles mostly in general. College Life : Personally college life, is not that great due to the lack of hangout zones both inside and outside the campus. Since the area is remote, there are no chill out zones outside too. The sports facilities are below average owning to the limited space of the college campus in the remote area but things are building up gradually. One may join college clubs and societies to participate in more of varied events and activities but the bitter truth is that the excitement and curiosity due to the scenic and appealing natural beauty will fade away in a few months and one may feel sort of trapped inside. The place is ideal for researchers who want a peaceful environment conducive to their work area. Hope that helps and excuse me for typos or grammatical errors, if any.

Hence you wont feel lack of facilities.Wifi speed is okay.It is fully surrounded by mountains so the view is awesome.There are two rivers beside campus (there are ways to them). Whenever you feel out you can go to them.I am not much of a city person so on holidays i mostly go to trek around with friends.Teachers are good. Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all. Look for CS they are just like any other college good. If you are good at coding and have nice outlook you can get a 20–25 easy. For mech guys (like me) have to work hard to get placement. The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you. For electrical I don’t have any reviews but they are more or less like mech guys besides the fact that they are sometimes(mostly) hired by IT giants. Again for internships you need to work hard, they are the same as placement. The only plus point is that we have a semester exchange program where you can to Germany and study a sem there. It is beneficial. EDIT1 : IIT Mandi has been literally very good in tech fests. It has been the number one new IIT in inter IIT tech meets. ",What is the current placement scenario at IIT Mandi?

Although life here is almost similar to any other good fully residential engineering college is India.  Let me put it down to as a short checklist. #1. Early morning classes.   				 [√]        Classes start as early as 8 am even during November.#2. Strict attendance requirements.    [√] 	 S-E-V-E-N-T-Y percent. And to top it all some teachers give marks for attendance. :'( #3. Mess food that will make you homesick. [√] You will miss your mother with almost every bite you take.#4. Canteens and Late night canteens.		 		 [√] Canteens. The best place to hangout at the start of the month. #5. Unfriendly Hitler type professors. 			 [x] * Most of them are friendly and experts in their fields. #6. Ragging.					 [x] Zero percent ragging. I and my CS team used to go in the fourth year hostel and play CS with them till 6 am. They were not only friendly but were equally cool. :) #7. Clubs that help you discover new passion and stick to the existing ones. [√] A lot of clubs and a lot to do.          More details here >> Indian Institute Of Technology Mandi#8. Nearby Malls, Cinema Theaters. 			[x] Well everything comes with a price. You'll have to sacrifice the city life, (un)fortunately. However there is one cinema hall in Mandi but the condition is not so good. #9. Some fests to lighten the mood.			[√]        It would unfair to say that all the fests here are legendary. But Exodia and Rann-Neeti are quite awesome if you get involved. :) Even the intra-college fests are cool, small but enjoyable. :)#10. Cool sports culture.				[√] Sport culture here is just awesome. Not just in the campus but even in Mandi, the people are great sports enthusiasts. Even during the end sems you can spot some people playing their favorite game.#11. Events to showcase your techincal and non-technical talents. [√]#12. Unlimited high speed internet .			[√]          Although it's has a lot of restrictions, but then restrictions are not there to prevent but to make you think/explore for a solution. That's all I can think of now.

But let me mention a few clear positives of being here: IIT Mandi’s location make it a great place to spend some time at. It is essentially a valley surrounded by mountains. The river (Uhl, which is a right bank tributary of the river Beas) flowing down through the campus is the most unique feature of it (It is not as dangerous as it sounds). It really adds much elegance to its beauty by its clean running waters. Needless to say, sereneness of Kamand village and simplicity of Himachali people are a big bonus. Regarding weather: It experiences temperature ranging between 25-30 degrees during summers and a min temp of 0 in winters (yet there would be no snowfall, the advantage of being in a valley). The duration between September to November is considered the most pleasant of all times. If you wanna step out of campus, famous Grand places like Kullu-Manali and two major awesome lakes: Prashar and Rewalsar are a few hours drive away. YOu must google them if you haven’t already. Unparalleled in beauty, heritage, spirituality and adventure, there can never be a reason to not visit Himachal Pradesh. Bottom-line: You are situated at a place where India spends its vacations. Its quite a good deal for students who like travel and adventure. I have missed a lot of details, hopefully other answers will cover it. :) ",Is IIT Mandi the most beautiful IIt campus?

The campus seemed small but on seeing pictures of older times when there were just 4–5 buildings in campus I thanked my luck! Here is a picture of campus from the last sem:  It has already grown , completing most of the in-construction buildings that you can see. The speed of construction here is absolutely insane to a person from Bombay like me! It amazes me that things can work at this speed in a place so remote. All thanks to our amazing Director, I suppose! This is a picture of the upcoming North Campus that we will later shift to.  NOW, get this, The North Campus and South Campus (where we are now) are separated by a mountain! I mean, How cool is that?! Of course, they are planning to connect the two, not only by road (which itself is just 5–10 minutes by buses). And coming to remoteness, it sure as hell is remote. All you can see are mountains. The permanent campus is about an hour away from the main Mandi town where we have to go to get most of the things needed. There are 2 canteens within the campus and a stall of sorts and a restaurant/cafe sort of thing. Once bored of visiting the same few joints within campus, you can go to The Treat ,outside campus, a 5–10 min walk from campus’s gate. Nothing out of the extraordinary, but decent enough. The provision and stationery stores fortunately save us from having to travel an hour just for a pencil or pen. So the first week is known as an Orientation week, organised by the awesome GCS (Guidance and Counselling Service) volunteers. It’s a whole lot of fun and you get to know a lot of the campus and a lot of people within it. Also, you find out a lot about Mandi town as well. :) I won’t spill their secrets, so you have fun in it if you’re planning to come! The sports trials take place and you ( being a girl ) get selected in all possible. I picked badminton, and started playing in the first week itself. The sports facility is surprisingly, commendable. After that, classes starts. Classes, since I’m sure you’d want to know, are decent. Some professors and really , mindblowingly good, but some aren’t. Sometimes, although the teacher may be brilliant you are just not made for the subjec t- this happened with me and Electrical systems around us. The instructor, Ramesh Oruganti, was amazing but for some reason I still got a C! Ah, well. It gets a bit monotonous soon, but they don’t let it stay that way. Soon there is Aakarshan and intros of each club. After Aakarshan, the freshers’ introduction to all the cultural clubs, there are auditions for core members of each. Simultaneously, the technical clubs begin their open sessions for the first years and we get introduced to all of them. Quizzes come and go and the semester goes on. We start making friends, and you get used to the place and all the greenery! Being one of the few girls is a bit difficult in the beginning but the girls stick together at that time. Later the boys get used to us and it’s normal. The sem goes on, sports events come up, convocation comes up, cult events (not many in odd sem) come up and technical events go on. You re-realize how beautiful the place is. For me, one of the best times of the first sem was when the Dance club and the Lit society decided to participate in Antaragni, IIT Kanpur’s fest. This is one of the best parts of being in a college with a small population. If you’re decent at anything, they take you in the club and teach you and make you better. I have learnt so much in the past year about so so many things and discovered so much more about myself. I certainly wouldn’t have had this opportunity. Somewhere near November, final trials for Inter IIT take place and crazy preparation begins. End-sems take place in the last week of November and after that, Inter IIT camp starts again and then you leave. ( well, we didn’t, because of the Chennai floods but this is the general scenario.) During November , fest work begins and people are taken into different teams and work begins and continues during the vacation. The vacation is unending. It. Is. Eternity. You lose your mind wanting to have something to do because you are completely jobless. You realise you have lost about 10 kgs in a semester and hog on some good home food and go to all your usual places and meet everybody you knew. Still, that ends but the vacation doesn’t. No work. Nothing to do. No clothes to wash, no room to keep clean, no technical event to participate , no dance practice NOTHING. It is horrible for a while and then either you get used to it or start doing something at home. This year, we hosted the Inter IIT Tech-Meet, in January, but since that came during vacations, only a handful people witnessed it. The second semester, you are super happy to be back but also, obviously missing the beautiful home food. Its similar to the first except much much much much much (I could go on for eternity) more hectic. Many more events take place, this time alongside course projects. You realize how free you were in the previous semester. And Exodia happens. All the work, since November, culminates into one grand event filled with absolutely no sleep and too much work . Your respect increases for the certain few who you know carried out the whole fest on their shoulders. Those three days are the best days of the year. At the end of it, there is victory. Lot of work left but still , it’s over. We have done it. Well, they have done it! It’s a good feeling. The sem goes on. You re-realize how beautiful the place is. All the fourth years are now filled with nostalgia and are way too free since they have few credits left to complete. So they keep their club meetings much more often and you go for them because “Aww they’re leaving soon” :( For a person like me, who is practically in each club , there are too many farewells to handle. But it was worth it. It surprises me how many people leaving have made such a huge impression on me within one year. We organize the farewells gladly and basically, party hard. The courses are tougher, at least for me, so we also have to work hard . This sem, no one gets much sleep. I suppose it’s going to get even worse with each year. And now, endsems are here again and I am here on Quora instead of there , studying. So what’s it like? Its amazing, painful, annoying, lonely, scary, brilliant, beautiful and TIRING everything at once. The people you meet are people you will remember forever and the knowledge you learn (no, I am not talking about the classes) will stay with you. The friends you make,you hope to keep forever and the memories you will certainly cherish for life. Of course, this is all if you get off your butt and go participate in whatever is going on. I have made it a point to spend most days (and many nights) out of my room, meeting people, making things, working, sometimes even studying, talking, partying, practicing, or maybe just walking with a friend or two. If you decide to sit in your room and surf Quora all day, then its the same as home .(Actually, it’s worse because its without the good food!) So, participate and IIT Mandi will gladly be there to help you. :) ",What's it like to attend IIT Mandi?

Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all. Look for CS they are just like any other college good. If you are good at coding and have nice outlook you can get a 20–25 easy. For mech guys (like me) have to work hard to get placement. The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you.

IIT Mandi’s vision is to be leader in science and technology education, knowledge creation and innovation, in an India marching towards a just, inclusive and sustainable society.  Campus Insights The Institute’s main campus, called Kamand Campus, is located in the picturesque Uhl river valley at Kamand, which is situated at about 15 kms from the historic town of Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. IIT Mandi is the first among new IITs to develop and use its main campus.  IIT Mandi permanent campus is located at Kamand and is divided into two parts: South and North Campus. All the 4 B.tech Batches along with some PG students stay at South Campus. Most of the PG students stay at North Campus. The residential campus in the serene landscape by the river Uhl offers a world-class academic environment with a high quality of life in a setting of natural splendor. The main campus of IIT Mandi at Kamand has well equipped class rooms and computing facilities. Good teaching laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Mechanical Engineering have been developed at Kamand campus.  Clubs The Tech-savvy students have formed various clubs related to Technology. Some of them are: Robotronics Club: A society which conducts regular workshops and combines the robotics with electronics along with the ""RoboWars"" for the ""Robo"" Freaks. Programming Club: A society ,especially for the coders, to explore new possibilities in programming and to put their skills to test at the same time. All technical clubs are active in organizing seminars and competitions. Many of the students have published research papers along with the faculty members with the assistance of the technical clubs. Societies and Events IIT Mandi witnesses a great participation in all the events conducted by the cultural and literary societies. These societies conduct events regularly for ensuring the development of the cultural and literary skills of the students.  The literary society of IIT Mandi EDLS (English Debating and Literary Society) makes sure that events like Group Discussions,Debates and Just a Minute are organised every two weeks to enhance the communication skills of the students. The Music society, Dramatics society and the Dance society are also very active in conducting competitions and group events with a view to ensure that the students learn the importance of a synchronized effort for victory. The dance, literary and music society participated in Antaragini at IIT Kanpur. Exodia is the annual Tech-Cult Fest of IIT Mandi. The events in Exodia brought together the creative skills and talents of the students and provided an enriching experience to one and all. Management of such a large scale fest is done entirely by students, from cold calling sponsors and inviting participating to real time management of the events. Hostel Facility  IIT Mandi has fully residential campus with the current strength of approximately 1300 students residing in 5 boys’ hostels and 2 girls’ hostels. At present these hostels are situated in the two campuses. The south campus consists four hostels; Prashar hostel, Suvalsar hostel, Nako hostel and Chandra Taal Hostel. The north campus has three hostels; Beas Kund Hostel, Dashir hostel and Gauri Kund hostel and one more is coming up.  Currently there are four messes in the campus, two each in both campuses, that serve food to all hostelers. The food quality and menu in these messes is regularly supervised and controlled by the team of mess secretaries elected by the students body. Besides, There are five to six canteens in campus that gives a variety of food options to students.  IIT Mandi can boast of world class hostel facilities inside the hostels, as all the hostels are equipped with WI-FI internet connection, LCD television, washing machine, cloth dryer, microwave oven, induction heater, refrigerator, electric iron and facilities for indoor games such table tennis, foosball, carom etc. Management of hostel is taken care by the warden and assistant warden with the help of a caretaker. Caretaker is available in the hostel round the clock. Each hostel has its own student general body of student representatives in the form of general secretary, cultural secretary, sports secretary and mess secretary. Sports  Sports occupy the pride of place in the hearts of the students of IIT Mandi.The college organises regular inter hostel and intra hostel sports events to promote the athletes and to encourage the students to improve their physical stamina. IIT Mandi has also participated in Inter IIT sports and has shown its flair in many events like cricket, aquatics, basketball, badminton, football, volleyball and table tennis. IIT Mandi has become the first newer IIT to win bronze medal in Table Tennis Girls. Library IIT Mandi has a Central Library located in the main campus. A growing collection of books and journals in soft and in print forms is housed in the central library. The Library currently houses over 18791 print books, 19622 e-books and provides access to more than 12000 e-journals. The library has also subscribed to e-books from several reputed publishers.

If someone has problems, you are most welcome to skip reading the content below. Campus : On a serious note, I feel IIT Mandi doesn’t have a good infrastructure, when compared with all others, in the entire IIT family. One should clearly remember that beautiful hills, mountains, rivers, waterfalls and clouds are not a part of the IIT Mandi campus. They are simply outside the campus and certainly not constructed by the development authorities. Stop saying that IIT Mandi has a beautiful campus just because of the natural resources present outside the campus and the hilly view is mesmerizing and beautiful. IIT Mandi has simply failed to build a good permanent and a planned campus despite of the fact that ~12 years have passed since its establishment. There are 2 campuses in IIT Mandi - North campus and the South campus. IIT Mandi’s South campus : The South campus is completely temporary in design and construction.The authorities keep on digging up and constructing stuff, again demolishing the same structures and performing the same construction again and this has been repeating for years.Majority of the construction in the south campus is temporary which will be demolished once the new director joins this year.As soon as you enter the south campus, a lot of structures on your left, as you walk towards the ground, are extremely poorly built just like local huts in any remote area and they exist even after years of college establishment.As you enter the South campus and proceed towards the main play-ground, you will find nothing but majority of washrooms on your left and that too poorly maintained and built. Which IIT campus in India, you will find series of washrooms as you soon as you enter the campus.Just at the beginning of the south campus, there is a local canteen called CVR canteen that serves the most unhygienic food on the entire campus. It is more of a provision store and less of a canteen. The level of hygiene here is simply unbearable. The cooks prepare food, take bath and wash clothes in the same kitchen itself. The prepared snacks are kept inside the glass containers full of insects, rodents including cockroaches. There is no cleanliness in the sitting area. I don’t feel such type of canteen should exist in any Indian college or university. They include over 50 different food items but prepare not more than 5 or 6. Any genuine complain against unhygienic setting etc. is not addressed properly. I personally feel, that the canteen is heavily and too much backed up, by the college authorities.Now coming to the ground, which is another spot for never ending construction. The policy they follow is simply to build, demolish and repeat. The authorities construct and demolish the structures again and again. Some issue with the civil department too, I guess.The pathways and the roads inside the South campus are extremely poor in quality and keeps worsening especially during rains.The most irritating part is the construction debris due to the entire campus being dug up again and again. The connecting sanitation and drainage pipelines are just not properly planned and implemented due to which water keeps flowing everywhere and getting collected.There are no proper canteens in the entire South campus where you can have reasonable and quality food. Few of the existing so called canteens operating inside the campus pay hefty amount of revenue to the college authorities which allow them to operate. There is a small stall like canteen called as ‘BulBul’ canteen that will prepare veg maggie and chicken in the same pan messing everything. Recently its owner was fined Rs. 5000 for utter unhygienic environment he has inside. No new vendors are allowed or given permit unless they agree to pay a heavy part of their money to college authorities. You cannot have simple south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, vada or good quality bakery items like burger, hotdog, puffs, pastry & cakes, sandwiches, pizzas etc. There is just one very simple canteen that serves extremely overpriced and very limited food items like desserts and shakes with no food variety at all. There are simply no provisions at all. There are no arrangements for any sort of fast food chains to operate inside the campus unlike all other IITs. Also since the area is remote, there are no hopes from outside the campus as well. You are suppose to travel to Mandi town to enjoy some of the delicacies or survive on maggie and parathas. Personally, I have stopped eating from any the canteens especially CVR and the BulBul.IIT Mandi’s North campus : IIT Mandi’s north campus is the most unplanned and illogical campus that any IIT may possibly have. The entire construction takes place at random and as I previously mentioned that they are still constructing the main sections of the campus even till today.The amount of planning that should have been involved while constructing the main North campus is zero. They constructed hostels right in front of the faculty and staff quarters. Also the architecture and design of the construction looks quite uglier. The buildings have just been whitewashed and the construction authorities still haven’t progressed to painting. There are broken pieces of big rocks and construction debris all over. The drainage pipes run from anywhere to everywhere spilling out water on the pathways and making it a complete mess during rains.Majority of the labs and hostels are still in construction. The existing labs are extremely poor on resources and basic lab facilities. The new lab in which I work is extremely low on seating capacity and system resources. Previously labs operated from the South campus and the situations were the same. The same is the situation for the students of the other departments as well. The college has simply failed to build decent lab and computing facilities even after so many years. Since the construction was poor in logic and design, so is the lab facility in most of the streams. Just placing some old systems & material in a small area does not constitute a premier and state of the art computing lab.There are almost no canteens available on the campus. They have recently opened a fast food outlet called ‘OneBite’ but again the quality and variety is very limited and promising. The college authorities still don’t actively supports the outlet yet. It is extremely surprising to see hygienic and quality checks happening in ‘OneBite’ but not at all in the unhygienic CVR or BulBul Canteen in the South campus just because they may be backed up by certain college authorities.Even it is the main campus of IIT Mandi, still they don’t have any fast-food or traditional Indian style restaurants operating on campus. IIT Roorkee has Subway, PizzaHut, IIT Kanpur has CCD, Dominoes, IIT Bombay has Nescafe and so on. I don’t remember the exact list of the food outlets and restaurants in other IITs as well but IIT Mandi practically has none. Both the campuses of IIT Mandi have no hostel canteens or late night canteens. However I found mess food to be very good in both the IIT campuses. D1 mess in South campus is simply great.There is no quality furniture in the labs, hostels and inside libraries. Also the amount of academic material that should be present inside an IIT library is way less. Since I work in the CSE department, to my utter surprise, the main CSE (MANAS) lab is extremely weak on seating capacities, quality furniture, lab equipments. Most of the system comprises of old material and components and haven’t been upgraded since years. I personally felt that most of the elite and premier schools in Delhi have a much better built computer labs than this, apart from few of the advanced computing facilities currently being integrated or already integrated into. It is surprising to witness a new generation IIT demonstrating so low standards of core computer science lab, despite of completing 10 years of its establishment.Outside the campus : Again, this parameter is disappointing as it is majority of the local people who aim for employment and business due to existing IIT. The restaurants are very local in nature and don’t offer quality and variety in food items. Again the same hygiene issue persists.There are a lot number of provision stores outside. If you visit nearby areas such as Salgi, Katindi or Kamand, you will find 99% of the shops are nothing but provision stores. I expected variety such as garments shop, cafeterias, footwear shops, stationary shops, medical stores etc. But to the utter disappointment, all the locals are operating provision stores.There is not even a single medical store outside the campus. The local food outlets also serve the same thing: tea, coffee, parathas and maggie.The CSE labs and infrastructure is still not sufficient and strong to provide best of the opportunities. The faculty is extremely good and competitive however and one should remember that they are ultimately practising traditional & conventional teaching methodology as well as just doing their job mostly as an another govt. service or duty. Extremely and extremely few of them are really helpful and motivating but others are not and the same story goes for most of the elite Indian engineering campuses. Placements : Placements are extremely good especially for the much coveted CSE stream. Top product based firms hire in good numbers from the campus. Overall extremely competitive placements are offered to its graduates. However core engineering departments still don’t have that great placements and those students opt for software or non-tech profile roles mostly in general. College Life : Personally college life, is not that great due to the lack of hangout zones both inside and outside the campus. Since the area is remote, there are no chill out zones outside too. The sports facilities are below average owning to the limited space of the college campus in the remote area but things are building up gradually. One may join college clubs and societies to participate in more of varied events and activities but the bitter truth is that the excitement and curiosity due to the scenic and appealing natural beauty will fade away in a few months and one may feel sort of trapped inside. The place is ideal for researchers who want a peaceful environment conducive to their work area. Hope that helps and excuse me for typos or grammatical errors, if any.

As number of students are not much so one get immense number of opportunities in evry field. ","How is IIT Mandi CS in terms of campus, placement and college life? "
" About College: The Indian Institute of Technology in Mandi (IIT- Mandi) was established in 2009. During the Eleventh 5- year plan, it was realized that there was a requirement to extend the number of elite institutions in the country.

Whenever you feel out you can go to them.I am not much of a city person so on holidays i mostly go to trek around with friends.Teachers are good. Off course you will not like some of them but it is good. After all we are the only IIT to have more staff than the sanctioned strength.Now comes the bad: The institute is still new and not in a major city you will feel it tough to gather sponsors for any event.(the situation improves every year, we will be having 3 pro nites this Exodia !!).The main city Mandi is around 40 mins from institute thus if you want to hang out at dominos or have good tea/coffee at some cafe you will have to travel at least 80 mins (back and fro).You will feel lack of equipments and space for music club. We feel that Music club room should be bigger with better speakers.If you are a robotronics guy you will mostly not find parts in Mandi and it is a pain. Especially if you to complete something fast. You have to either go to Chandigarh or Delhi (maybe Shimla) to get things done.I have Apple devices and the nearest service centre. is in in Shimla, so if you buy or have replacement you need to go to Shimla.I have not experienced any other difficulty till now. Will update later.My life at IIT Mandi is just awesome. I get a lot of free time and is involved in some projects. Being in new college I get exposure to lot of new projects which are generally done 2nd -3rd yearites. Plus you get the opportunity to be core member of many clubs. Study is good and not at all stressful like JEE. (where 50 percent has to break their a** to get here). We have two quizzes and an end semester. The quiz of an hour and are over in a over a week. Also if you like to do multiple projects but don’t have enough motivation to start new projects , don't worry you have to a project every year to get grades. If you study smartly you can have a CG of 9 above (in 1 sem) easily. For above 9 just attend most classes. And even after all this stuff you can find time to pursue a hobby and play sports. Overall you will be always busy with some stuff or other (if you are not a Maggu/lame). Now for those who are reading this answer to find out placements and all. Look for CS they are just like any other college good. If you are good at coding and have nice outlook you can get a 20–25 easy. For mech guys (like me) have to work hard to get placement. The truth is this is the case all over India there are very few core companies so to get into them is tough. But mech is a branch which you pursue solely for your interest,some guys can get an awesome placement while others may be no. The for mech this year is 17 lac in HOCL (a PSU). Or you can apply of campus to companies like BM and Merc. it is all on you. For electrical I don’t have any reviews but they are more or less like mech guys besides the fact that they are sometimes(mostly) hired by IT giants. Again for internships you need to work hard, they are the same as placement. The only plus point is that we have a semester exchange program where you can to Germany and study a sem there.

"Hi, IIT Mandi hostels are too good than the expected images of hostels. Girls and Boys hostel design are alike more or less. In kamand campus 2/3 sharing rooms are being availed to students. Each hostel consists of 3 floors with the facilities such as laundry room, Iron, Induction pan, kettle, Washrooms(good enough :P). Verdict: You’ll not find these hostels deprived of any facility as such, they are good enough for the well conduction of your studies and fun at the same time.

You just need to be attentive in class and do the assignments yourself.,What are branch changing rules at IIT Mandi? How difficult is it?
"Yes, they do. Here at IIT Mandi, we have interdisciplinary learning and we have schools instead of Departments. There are no Dept. Of CS Engg. and Dept. Of Electrical Engg.! Instead, we have SCEE (School of Computing and Electrical Engineering). One advantage is that If you come with EE and realise that you want to go to IT sector, you can easily take up courses of CSE, sometimes more than CSE guys do.",Does electrical and cse department in Mandi coincide?

"As said on the above comment placement scenario is more or less same in all the IIT's established during 2008, 2009. All of them have good companies coming for placements, there might be a difference in the number of companies coming for placements in each of these IIT's but judging only by the number of companies will not be appropriate because strength in each IIT also matters. Taking about placements of CSE in IIT Mandi, this year the average package offered was 18.36 lakhs and from the past 4-5 years it is around 16-18 lakhs. Other new gen IIT's also have avg package either around this or less than this, but none has significantly greater than this. If you work hard then at the end you will definately land up getting placed in good company from a campus. Also, by the time you will have your placements after 4 years, there will surely be many more companies coming to IIT Mandi. In case of any other doubts, feel free to ping me.",What is the scenario of placements of CSE at iit mandi is it better than other new gen. iits?

"Data Science at IIT Mandi to a great extent will be comparable to CSE only. Many of the courses will be similar or even same! (Some dedicated core Data Science courses are introduced in the curriculum though and those are the only ones which differentiate the branches.) I don't believe you're completely aware about either of the branches currently. I'd definitely suggest to join the Data Science course, irrespective of it starting this year only. And hence, advise you to come here, explore the courses related to both the branches (while being in DSE) and then decide about changing your branch from DSE (you may just want to stay in DSE as it won't make much difference IMO) At last, the 'risk' you're thinking you may have to take will be very little compared to other branches. Because even if you stay in DSE, I'd say, it'll be as good as CSE at IIT Mandi. Hope this helps!","What do seniors think about the Data Science course at IIT Mandi ? I have an inclination towards CSE but won't be getting it here , though I may get Data Science. Do you recommend joining it considering the fact that it is starting only from this year. Moreover , what is your opinion about joining it considering branch change to CSE. Do you recommend taking this risk?"
