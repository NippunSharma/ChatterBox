GSoC selections for 2020:
  Indore : 3 students
  Ropar : 2 students
  Patna : 6 students
  Hyderabad : 1 student
  Bhubaneshwar : 1 student
  Gandhinagar : Noone from their college knows (I think 0)

  Indore is better than us in ICPC(competitive programming) only because they have been to world finals thrice but we are improving upon that too year by year. Couldn't find data for IIT Indore hosted anywhere.
