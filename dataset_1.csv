0,Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities? Are the mountain roads easy to travel or is there any danger? ,"Yes, IIT Mandi is safe from avalanche, flood, landslides and other natural calamities. I agree that mountains roads are not safe for journey in rainy season and Snow fall duration. But if you are coming to mandi from chandigarh then you can easily come to campus. But if you are coming to mandi from manali side then in rainy season you may face land slides and other things but himachal government is very active regarding to help people in the case of land slides and heavy snow fall. So if you are thinking about be a part of IIT Mandi then feel free to try to be a part of IIT Mandi. "
1,Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities? Are the mountain roads easy to travel or is there any danger? ,Avalanches occur at places where it snow heavily and a wide layer of snow is present on the mountains. Here there is no such snow so no chances of avalanche. In rainy season sometimes landslides occur on the road joining South and North campus as well as Road towards Mandi. But IIT MANDI has installed landslide sensors which alert the nearby people. So there is no such risk. The only problem in mountain roads is it takes much more time to travel as compared to plains. For eg: Distance b/w IIT KAMAND campus and MANDI town is 15 kms and it takes around 45 minutes for us to travel. 
2,Is IIT Mandi safe from avalanche and other natural calamities? Are the mountain roads easy to travel or is there any danger? ,"IIT Mandi is safe and peaceful place. No avalanches and well connected with roads. No issues. But, in rainy season there can be landslides anywhere in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh. So, uncertainty of landslide is still everywhere in every mountain of Himachal. Though there is extensive research going on for forecasting landslides points at mountains. Overall there is no such regular natural disaster kind of things. Safe and peacefulness of IIT Mandi can make us in love with nature. "
3,Is the Uhl river near IIT Mandi dangerous? ,"Good Question! Okay, so when I had heard about the fact that my campus (then going to be) has a river flowing through it, I was so damn excited that I literally started to have dreams about it. I'm an amid nature lover, can wander for days, travelling is my wife and photography is my girlfriend. Sorry to have an extramarital affair!

Okay, so when I had heard about the fact that my campus (then going to be) has a river flowing through it, I was so damn excited that I literally started to have dreams about it. I'm an amid nature lover, can wander for days, travelling is my wife and photography is my girlfriend. Sorry to have an extramarital affair! I was so mesmerised when I first saw it, viewing those clouds floating above like a carefree traveller and in those misty and fluffy clouds I could see my days ahead very clearly, ironically! Within a weak, I went on its shore, touched it's crystal clear blue water and even wrote a poem sitting on a rock there for a couple of hours. As they say, once you've taken a step it's hard to reconcile. That first visit instilled in me the desire to embrace those moments again…and again…and again. Me and my friends once even bunked the classes to go and take a bath in it some 7–8 kms from our campus. That was an amazing day, we returned with wet clothes, loadful of laughter, a couple of nicknames and lots of memories to go down the pages of my “campus diary”. The river became a part of my life, just like the mountains had…just like the campus had… …until my birthday this year, the year 2017. When my friends were planning a surprise party for my birthday and I with my other batchmate was looking for my friend. “Looking” is not the word that screams the aura of that moment…”searching” might do the job. It was just a packet of few students who got serious about him missing, but it didn't take much ticks of the clock that entire campus got involved. It was a tensed moment. I am not going to narrate the incident, I'm not the right person for that. But it was around 1:30 am, 17th Feb 2017…i was getting wishing calls from my relatives and there I heard the gravest new. The river dried that night, the river dried for me. Since that day, I've not stepped on the shore of that river. Truth this, I couldn't dare to. It's been a couple of months since that night, and now when I've been knocked into my senses again I want to say this. The river is not dangerous. Look, it was an accident. No good will come out finding the flaws in it. But a couple of lessons would surely enlighten us. NEVER underestimate the power of nature. It's the most beautiful and the most dangerous creation. I'm not saying stop enjoying it, but enjoy within your sphere. Don't get carried away with your adrenaline rush, keep a check on it. Break the rules, not laws. Go visit the river, but never go when it's dark. And never go alone. You don't know what magic a hand on your shoulder can do when you need it. Don't experiment, like climbing on things which are not approachable. Of course, it could be new experience but ask yourself at what cost? The Uhl is one of the many blessings that IIT Mandi is blessed with. It sings you a soft lullaby every night. It adds the mesmerising hue of sunset to your tea every evening. It listens to you when no one else does. You can sit for hours looking at it from the campus and it won't stop surprising you. And not to forget those countless selfies! The river is beautiful, it's amazing and it's not dangerous. And even now if I'm unable to express that the river is not dangerous, then probably everything is dangerous. The bike you drive. The room you stay in. The food you eat. The friends you meet. You just have to keep everything withing limits, don't break the limits. The only limits to be broken are your own, not others'. "
4,Is the Uhl river near IIT Mandi dangerous? ,"“One can remain safe as long as one heeds to the advice of elders and take actions consciously”. Talking about Uhl river, the water level of the river is quite unpredictable. In mountains, rains can happen anytime and the water level rises. That’s why time and again, Institute keeps on informing students about the risks involved in going to the river side. Multiple warning signs have been installed and security guards have been appointed at every possible location of going near the river.

We can only learn from the mistakes of the past and improve so that such incidents don’t occur again. It is therefore advised to not go near riverside. If one is very much of fond of going near the river, then you can have that fun by being a part of institute’s hiking & trekking club which keeps on organising activities like river crossing under the supervision of trained professionals.

5,How is the road in hilly areas connecting Delhi to IIT Mandi? ,"NH 1 connects Delhi to Chandigarh so you’ll hardly find any trouble till Chandigarh. If you are travelling by bus, you can find a direct bus( Volvo/ Ordinary) from Delhi till Mandi. Speaking of roads, there won’t be any trouble, roads are good. But yeah, it takes aroud 5–6 hours from Chandigarh to Mandi. From Mandi there is regular bus service from the transit campus to Kamand campus( no road issues). You can find the scedule here: http://iitmandi.ac.in/files/Institute%20Vehicle%20Schedule%2011%20June%202018.pdf (Look for Mandi to South column). "
6,How is the road in hilly areas connecting Delhi to IIT Mandi? ,Hmm someone finally cared;) Well as a student of IIT Mandi I can answer it pretty much well. I am from Haryana and the Roads are good. But if you are afraid of heights then be prepared as some roads near campus are very steep and curvy(and sometimes without railinB;-) ) But once you come here you are safe and trust me campus is really beautiful and serine. See you in 2019. Come witness the Moksha PEACE 
7,How do I reach IIT Mandi from Chandigarh in the safest way possible? ,"All the answers are pretty much self explanatory but I guess your emphasis are on the ‘safe’ part rather than the ‘reaching’ part. Let's start with a newspaper report conveying a staggering data. In Himachal, 1,000 die in road accidents every year - Times of India Tbh, I am not sure of the authenticity of this report.

Considering the dysmal road conditions in Himachali villages, I would think this data might skew us in believing that this statistic holds true for major highways as well. During my time at IIT Mandi, I used to travel to and from Chandigarh every semester. I personally have never encountered such a happening on Chandigarh - Manali highway. The Volvo drivers are extremely skilled & agile and road conditions are much better than in the inner reaches of HP. But the ride is not that comfortable considering the number of bends on the highway. Then again, who said reaching heaven was easy? :) Safe journey! "
8,How do I reach IIT Mandi from Chandigarh in the safest way possible? ,You can only take a bus/ cab from Mandi. The most comfortable are the Volvo buses that you can book from hrtc ticketing website. It's perfectly safe and very common. The drivers are experienced and well trained for these routes. Even the route is fairly straight and wide. 
9,What are the bus timings from Chandigarh to Mandi? When are the first and last buses to Mandi from Chandigarh? ,Full day and full night .. Plenty of buses from chandigarh to mandi Sector 43 After 2 pm frequency is less ..Try to opt night buses these buses will drop you at mandi in early morning Total travel time by ordinary bus is approx 6 hrs And by Volvo is 5 hrs   
10,What are the bus timings from Chandigarh to Mandi? When are the first and last buses to Mandi from Chandigarh? ,"Haryana Roadways, HRTC and Punjab Roadways) are frequently available in every 5 minutes and 24*7. You can get a bus from Sector 43-bus stand. Bus service is widely distributed to Shimla so you don’t need to wry about time, just go to stand and you can get your bus. Volvo bus is also available for Shimla. Another way is that you can get a taxi or you can take zoomcar. Zoomcar is rental car service that charges according to the usage of car and petrol. You can book a car online and take that one but one thing I forget to mention that you have to drive the car on your own in zoomcar service. "

Yeah it's a general query which arises in everyone's mind as on one hand you have Cs in a new iit and relatively lower branch in an old iit .Well the straight forward solution to your query is If you have genuine intrest towards computer science and coding and you enjoy solving problems logically with patience then without considering anything go for iit mandi cs.You would not have to worry about placement here and you can also pursue research here.If you do not have sufficient information about coding the I would advise you to get in touch with it and realise yourself whether you enjoy coding or not. Whereas iitkgp being one of the most reputed institutes of india it will be a nice choice if you opt chemical engineering here as this industry is in dire demands nowadays and will be in future ,and it's course structure is relatively easy as compared to other departments like mech or electrical.You will have sufficient time to hone your other skills and enjoy your college life.In this way you can prepare yourself fir non core jobs as most of the companies allow chemical students to appear in placement interviews and internships.If you want to pursue MBA outside India being a kgpian will give you an edge over other as it's ranking is much better than iit mandi.Moreover you have an option of branch change here at the end of 1 year ,you just need to get a good cgpa and you can choose department of your choice but that solely should not be the criteria to choose college or branch.So the argument here is between a branch and a college and I have presented my views and would suggest you if you want to stay safe then going for mandi cs would be better option and if you don't feel comfortable with coding stuff then kgp chemical will be better.

13,Is IIT Mandi or Bits Pilani better for studying Computer Science? ,"I can't tell or advice you about the choice you should make but being an IIT Mandi CSE student, I can highlight some of the pros and cons of studying CSE at IIT Mandi. Pros: First of all, the scenic beauty of the Himalayas. Given the knowledge that it is also close to your home, you would love to be at Mandi. Though eventually you might end up disliking the mountains because of your 4 years stay there. This happened to a lot of my friends but the same was not the case with me.

Pros: First of all, the scenic beauty of the Himalayas. Given the knowledge that it is also close to your home, you would love to be at Mandi. Though eventually you might end up disliking the mountains because of your 4 years stay there. This happened to a lot of my friends but the same was not the case with me. I still love them as much I loved them when I first went to IIT Mandi.The opportunities are numerous. Since, the amount of students is less in IIT Mandi, you will get a lot of opportunities in every field. In my first year, I was not a very good TT player but still I made it to Inter IIT sports tournament. Well this is a really great thing because I have seen my friends in other IITs who have much more talent than me and still struggle to get into the Inter IIT team and eventually are not able to make it because there are students who are more talented than them.The opportunities don't limit to the Inter IIT sports fest. You get to participate in each and every student club activity. Given that we had less number of students, the cultural and technical clubs were open to all the students without any sort of recruitment. But this does not mean that you won't have to work anywhere. The students who did not work eventually separated out from the people who did.Easy approach to faculty and staff. Where it takes a lot of days to get your request processed in a big college, you will find it extremely easy to approach any teacher or staff for any problem. Even the Director is easily accessible.Cons: The Campus. I think I don't need to explain this drawback. But for details, permanent campus which is being built in Kamand, 15 kms ahead of Mandi is going to be really good when it completes.The lack of faculty. You will face a serious problem in this area because this is a new IIT and most of the teachers you see will be inexperienced.No recreational facilities. You must know beforehand that people of Mandi are very conservative and there is no source of entertainment on weekends like malls or shopping complexes. There is only one theater and believe me you will not want to go and see a movie there unless you see the price which is 30-40 Rs. per ticket. So, in all you will be spending the weekend either in the room sleeping, or talking with friends or visiting the campus just because you have to download some movies or TV serials. It will be really good if you make trekking as one of your habits.College Culture. There is no defined culture or college life as you consider it. You will not be able to get the real feel of a college life.The Placements. There comes the issue which you will probably be most worried about. I must say that there were very less number of companies which came for internships and jobs, in contrast to BITS Pilani where the number is much larger. The reasons being that it is a new IIT and that the place is very inaccessible. Most of the companies just deny coming to the college because it is 7 hours journey by bus from Chandigarh. Though there is a airport at Bhuntar (2 hours away) but you can say that it is almost non functional.Well, given all the points in favor and against, I would suggest you one thing. Don't rely on opinion of other people because everyone has his/her own perspective. When I entered into IIT Mandi, my friends mocked me for having made such a bad choice but I ended up getting placed at Amazon Development Center, India. So, set your preferences and then make a decision because at the end whichever college you go to, what will matter is not the contribution of college but the hard work you did. Best of luck for your coming years :D "
14,Is IIT Mandi or Bits Pilani better for studying Computer Science? ,"BITS Pilani. I don't think that it should be a difficult choice. I'll tell you why: (1) Placements: BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus) CSE has had an awesome track record as far as placements are concerned and by that I mean comparable to the old IITs. As placements at the new IITs are not yet at par with their older counterparts, IIT Mandi will take some time to reach there.

Also there is a huge difference between the number of companies that visit at BITS Pilani (Pilani) and the new IITs given the reputation and alumni presence of BITS Pilani. Apart from tech. companies a lot consultancy firms and banks come to Pilani for recruitment which broadens your future prospects. (2) Research: The research opportunities that you get at BITS are phenomenal with their system of SOP/COP/LOP (Study/Computer/Lab Oriented Project) which you can take up from your 2nd year itself. Also the opportunities that you get through PS-I( compulsory summer Intern after your 2nd year) and PS-II( compulsory 6 months long internship or 6 months long thesis opportunity after your 3rd year) are invaluable as an undergrad.  (3) Campus culture/ Peer group: BITS Pilani will give you an awesome peer group (with the No Reservation Policy) which I think is very important. Also the campus culture is well developed which I think you will miss at IIT Mandi as someone has already pointed out ""you won't get the feel of a good college life"". The campus culture at BITS  is great, with a large number of clubs and departments it gives you ample opportunities to develop yourself over your college years. Fests like Oasis ( the best after IIT Bombay's Mood Indigo) and Apogee are an awesome experience.  (4) Alumni: BITS has got a very strong alumni network. I think the alumni network of BITS is one of it's kind, with groups like BITS2MSPHD, BITS2BSCHOOL and BITStoIAS the alumni are constantly connected to the current students and are really helpful. Now the only issue i guess is the fees at BITS. Yeah It is costly, but with the hike in the fees there has been a rise in the number of scholarships they offer too. btw many congratulations to you on getting a great JEE rank and an awesome BITSAT score. Good Luck :) "

If someone has problems, you are most welcome to skip reading the content below. Campus : On a serious note, I feel IIT Mandi doesn’t have a good infrastructure, when compared with all others, in the entire IIT family. One should clearly remember that beautiful hills, mountains, rivers, waterfalls and clouds are not a part of the IIT Mandi campus. They are simply outside the campus and certainly not constructed by the development authorities. Stop saying that IIT Mandi has a beautiful campus just because of the natural resources present outside the campus and the hilly view is mesmerizing and beautiful. IIT Mandi has simply failed to build a good permanent and a planned campus despite of the fact that ~12 years have passed since its establishment. There are 2 campuses in IIT Mandi - North campus and the South campus. IIT Mandi’s South campus : The South campus is completely temporary in design and construction.The authorities keep on digging up and constructing stuff, again demolishing the same structures and performing the same construction again and this has been repeating for years.Majority of the construction in the south campus is temporary which will be demolished once the new director joins this year.As soon as you enter the south campus, a lot of structures on your left, as you walk towards the ground, are extremely poorly built just like local huts in any remote area and they exist even after years of college establishment.As you enter the South campus and proceed towards the main play-ground, you will find nothing but majority of washrooms on your left and that too poorly maintained and built. Which IIT campus in India, you will find series of washrooms as you soon as you enter the campus.Just at the beginning of the south campus, there is a local canteen called CVR canteen that serves the most unhygienic food on the entire campus. It is more of a provision store and less of a canteen. The level of hygiene here is simply unbearable. The cooks prepare food, take bath and wash clothes in the same kitchen itself. The prepared snacks are kept inside the glass containers full of insects, rodents including cockroaches. There is no cleanliness in the sitting area. I don’t feel such type of canteen should exist in any Indian college or university. They include over 50 different food items but prepare not more than 5 or 6. Any genuine complain against unhygienic setting etc. is not addressed properly. I personally feel, that the canteen is heavily and too much backed up, by the college authorities.Now coming to the ground, which is another spot for never ending construction. The policy they follow is simply to build, demolish and repeat. The authorities construct and demolish the structures again and again. Some issue with the civil department too, I guess.The pathways and the roads inside the South campus are extremely poor in quality and keeps worsening especially during rains.The most irritating part is the construction debris due to the entire campus being dug up again and again. The connecting sanitation and drainage pipelines are just not properly planned and implemented due to which water keeps flowing everywhere and getting collected.There are no proper canteens in the entire South campus where you can have reasonable and quality food. Few of the existing so called canteens operating inside the campus pay hefty amount of revenue to the college authorities which allow them to operate. There is a small stall like canteen called as ‘BulBul’ canteen that will prepare veg maggie and chicken in the same pan messing everything. Recently its owner was fined Rs. 5000 for utter unhygienic environment he has inside. No new vendors are allowed or given permit unless they agree to pay a heavy part of their money to college authorities. You cannot have simple south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, vada or good quality bakery items like burger, hotdog, puffs, pastry & cakes, sandwiches, pizzas etc. There is just one very simple canteen that serves extremely overpriced and very limited food items like desserts and shakes with no food variety at all. There are simply no provisions at all. There are no arrangements for any sort of fast food chains to operate inside the campus unlike all other IITs. Also since the area is remote, there are no hopes from outside the campus as well. You are suppose to travel to Mandi town to enjoy some of the delicacies or survive on maggie and parathas. Personally, I have stopped eating from any the canteens especially CVR and the BulBul.IIT Mandi’s North campus : IIT Mandi’s north campus is the most unplanned and illogical campus that any IIT may possibly have. The entire construction takes place at random and as I previously mentioned that they are still constructing the main sections of the campus even till today.The amount of planning that should have been involved while constructing the main North campus is zero. They constructed hostels right in front of the faculty and staff quarters. Also the architecture and design of the construction looks quite uglier. The buildings have just been whitewashed and the construction authorities still haven’t progressed to painting. There are broken pieces of big rocks and construction debris all over. The drainage pipes run from anywhere to everywhere spilling out water on the pathways and making it a complete mess during rains.Majority of the labs and hostels are still in construction. The existing labs are extremely poor on resources and basic lab facilities. The new lab in which I work is extremely low on seating capacity and system resources. Previously labs operated from the South campus and the situations were the same. The same is the situation for the students of the other departments as well. The college has simply failed to build decent lab and computing facilities even after so many years. Since the construction was poor in logic and design, so is the lab facility in most of the streams. Just placing some old systems & material in a small area does not constitute a premier and state of the art computing lab.There are almost no canteens available on the campus. They have recently opened a fast food outlet called ‘OneBite’ but again the quality and variety is very limited and promising. The college authorities still don’t actively supports the outlet yet. It is extremely surprising to see hygienic and quality checks happening in ‘OneBite’ but not at all in the unhygienic CVR or BulBul Canteen in the South campus just because they may be backed up by certain college authorities.Even it is the main campus of IIT Mandi, still they don’t have any fast-food or traditional Indian style restaurants operating on campus. IIT Roorkee has Subway, PizzaHut, IIT Kanpur has CCD, Dominoes, IIT Bombay has Nescafe and so on. I don’t remember the exact list of the food outlets and restaurants in other IITs as well but IIT Mandi practically has none. Both the campuses of IIT Mandi have no hostel canteens or late night canteens. However I found mess food to be very good in both the IIT campuses. D1 mess in South campus is simply great.There is no quality furniture in the labs, hostels and inside libraries. Also the amount of academic material that should be present inside an IIT library is way less. Since I work in the CSE department, to my utter surprise, the main CSE (MANAS) lab is extremely weak on seating capacities, quality furniture, lab equipments. Most of the system comprises of old material and components and haven’t been upgraded since years. I personally felt that most of the elite and premier schools in Delhi have a much better built computer labs than this, apart from few of the advanced computing facilities currently being integrated or already integrated into. It is surprising to witness a new generation IIT demonstrating so low standards of core computer science lab, despite of completing 10 years of its establishment.Outside the campus : Again, this parameter is disappointing as it is majority of the local people who aim for employment and business due to existing IIT. The restaurants are very local in nature and don’t offer quality and variety in food items. Again the same hygiene issue persists.There are a lot number of provision stores outside. If you visit nearby areas such as Salgi, Katindi or Kamand, you will find 99% of the shops are nothing but provision stores. I expected variety such as garments shop, cafeterias, footwear shops, stationary shops, medical stores etc. But to the utter disappointment, all the locals are operating provision stores.There is not even a single medical store outside the campus. The local food outlets also serve the same thing: tea, coffee, parathas and maggie.The CSE labs and infrastructure is still not sufficient and strong to provide best of the opportunities. The faculty is extremely good and competitive however and one should remember that they are ultimately practising traditional & conventional teaching methodology as well as just doing their job mostly as an another govt. service or duty. Extremely and extremely few of them are really helpful and motivating but others are not and the same story goes for most of the elite Indian engineering campuses. Placements : Placements are extremely good especially for the much coveted CSE stream. Top product based firms hire in good numbers from the campus. Overall extremely competitive placements are offered to its graduates. However core engineering departments still don’t have that great placements and those students opt for software or non-tech profile roles mostly in general. College Life : Personally college life, is not that great due to the lack of hangout zones both inside and outside the campus. Since the area is remote, there are no chill out zones outside too. The sports facilities are below average owning to the limited space of the college campus in the remote area but things are building up gradually. One may join college clubs and societies to participate in more of varied events and activities but the bitter truth is that the excitement and curiosity due to the scenic and appealing natural beauty will fade away in a few months and one may feel sort of trapped inside. The place is ideal for researchers who want a peaceful environment conducive to their work area. Hope that helps and excuse me for typos or grammatical errors, if any.
